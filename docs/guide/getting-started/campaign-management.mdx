# Campaign Management on the Usher Platform

## Introduction

Welcome to the Campaign Management section, where we'll guide you through the process of setting up and managing
campaigns on the Usher platform. Effective campaign management is crucial to maximizing the potential of your partner
programs. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with the know-how to create and manage campaigns effectively on
Usher.

## Creating and Configuring Campaigns

### Campaign Object Basics

Before diving into campaign creation, it's essential to understand the Campaign Object, which consists of immutable
campaign terms, mutable campaign details, and the brand/advertiser profile. Immutable terms define the core structure of
your campaign, while mutable details and profiles allow for customization and flexibility.
