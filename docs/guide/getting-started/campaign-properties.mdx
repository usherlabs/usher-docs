# Campaign Properties

This table lists all of the properties that can be configured within a Campaign.

| Object Property Name/Key | Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | string | The identifier of the Campaign. This could be an ID within a Smart Contract or a Blockchain Transaction Address, depending on the `chain`. | true |
| chain | string | The blockchain identifier. i.e., `arweave`, `ethereum`, `polygon`. | true |
| owner | string | The Wallet Address associated with the Brand/Advertiser. | false |
| events | array | An array of Conversion Events. These events represent different stages in the Referred User's journey where Conversions are tracked. | false |

| events[].nativeLimit | integer | An arbitrary value that restricts the conversions processed for a given event for the referred/native user. Where a `Conversion.nativeId` is provided, the Referred User can continue triggering conversions until the sum of all `Conversion.commit` values meets this `nativeLimit`. | false |
| events[].perCommit | integer | Defines the reward amount in relation to the `conversion.commit` value, such that `reward = rate * (commit / perCommit)`, if no reward perCommit is defined. | false |

| reward.limit | integer | A limit on the total rewards for the campaign. Once this limit is reached in claimed rewards, the Campaign is considered complete. | false |
