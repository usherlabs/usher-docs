# Partner Programs

## Introduction

Partnerships play a vital role in driving brand growth and success. This section highlights the benefits of partner-driven performance-based marketing and shares best practices to help you get the most out of your collaborations.

## Types of Partners

Three types of partners can be distinguished to help you understand how each type can support your brand:

- **Affiliate Partners**: These partners use Usher Invite links to drive traffic from their audience to your application, earning a commission for referring people successfully.
- **Referral Partners**: With a direct relationship with referred users, referral partners use Usher Invite links to generate high-quality leads, redirecting users to your platform.
- **Reseller Partners**: Reseller partners promote and sell your project by leveraging their expertise and customer base. They use Usher Invite links to direct customers and earn commissions throughout the user's lifecycle.

## Tailoring Campaigns for Different Partners

When setting up campaigns, it's essential to customize rewards based on the partner type and service supported, ensuring a targeted and effective approach.

For consumer-facing services, it's recommended to offer smaller rewards per referral. These services typically have a broader user base, requiring more leads to generate substantial revenue.

In contrast, business-facing services benefit from providing higher rewards per referral. With a higher value per lead, offering more substantial incentives can attract quality referrals and drive growth.

Adjusting the reward strategy based on your target audience and specific use case is crucial. Furthermore, don't hesitate to explore creative avenues in Web3 development to create innovative partner programs. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and experimenting with novel approaches, you can maximize your campaign's potential and foster valuable collaborations.

## Tips for a Successful Partner Program

To establish successful collaborations with Usher, follow these guidelines:

- Clearly define objectives and expectations for each partner program.
- Align campaign configurations with your product or service and targeted partner type.
- Provide ample support and resources to help partners succeed.
- Regularly evaluate partner performance and make adjustments to maximize value.
- Be prepared for a long-term marketing strategy that may be arduous to establish but very cost-effective when successful as capital is only spent when outcomes are achieved â€” hence the fitting description of pay-for-performance marketing.
